# No insecure TYPO3 extensions

This package is inspired by [roave/security-advisories](https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories).
When you require this package it ensures that you can not load TYPO3 extensions in versions with known
vulnerabilities.

**This package is experimental so far and does only contain [TYPO3 security bulletins](https://typo3.org/help/security-advisories/) from 2018.**
